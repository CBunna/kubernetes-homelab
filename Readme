Install Prometheus and Grafana
install them inside  Kubernetes cluster — as pods running on any of the nodes (doesn’t matter if it's worker or master node).
This is the standard, scalable, and Kubernetes-native way. 

Use kube-prometheus-stack
Install the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart. It includes:

Prometheus

Grafana

Node Exporter (for metrics)

Alertmanager

All configurations ready to monitor your cluster

Installation:

Add the Helm repo:
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

Create the namespace:
helm install prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring

Wait for pods to be running:
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-stack-grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring

Then open: http://localhost:3000
Default login:

user: admin

password: prom-operator (you can change this)

After Installation
Prometheus will auto-discover all Kubernetes components and start collecting metrics.

Grafana will have pre-built dashboards.

You can also create custom dashboards.
